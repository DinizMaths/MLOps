# Introduction

## 🤔 What is ML (Machine Learning)?

Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. In a traditional software, we have a set of rules that the computer follows to solve a problem.

```python
if (x > 0):
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is negative")
```

When we need a lot of rules, the software becomes very complex and difficult to maintain. In Machine Learning, we give the computer a set of data and the computer learns the rules by itself. For example, we give the computer a set of images of 🐱 cats and 🐶 dogs and the computer learns how to differentiate between cats and dogs.
