# Introduction

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the course of **Machine Learning-Based Systems Design**, an integral part of the Computer Engineering undergraduate program. Here, you can follow the studies and projects developed in this course.

# Projects

This section contains a collection of links to projects directories focused on practical applications of machine learning and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) principles. Feel free to explore the subdirectories within this section to access project documentation, code, and related materials. Each project provides hands-on solutions.
